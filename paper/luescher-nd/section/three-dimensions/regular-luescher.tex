    \label{fig:continuum-extrapolation-spectrum}
    Continuum extrapolation of the discrete finite volume spectrum with $L=1\,[\mathrm{fm}]$.
    Each column represents a different implementation of the kinetic operator, rows correspond to eigenvalues of the hamiltonian sorted by value.
    For visualization purposes we present each second eigenvalue starting at $E_2$ ($E_0$ was used to tune the interaction and is thus constant by construction).
    Black dots are the eigenvalues at different lattice spacings, the green band is the model averaged fit function for best parameters and the blue band parallel to the x-axis is the continuum-extrapolated energy.
    The uncertainty is dominated by the fluctuations over models; the propagated numerical uncertainty is negligible in comparison.
    The dashed line corresponds to the expected result obtained by computing the intersection of the zeta function $S^{\spherical}_3$ with the phase shifts.
    The boundary of each frame corresponds to the poles of the zeta function.
    Different energy extrapolations in the continuum agree with zeros of the \Luscher zeta within uncertainty.
    For finite discretization implementations ($n_s < \infty$), the uncertainty drastically increases with the number of excited states ($\sim 3$ orders of magnitude from $E_2^{(n_s)}$ to $E_{20}^{(n_s)}$).

After tuning the contact interaction to the first zero of the spherical zeta function, we compute the spectrum of the hamiltonian.
Next, we extrapolate the obtained energy eigenvalues to the continuum $\epsilon \to 0$ using a polynomial fit
\begin{equation}
    E^{(n_s)}_i(\epsilon) = E_i^{(n_s)} + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{n_\mathrm{max}} e_{i,n}^{(n_s)} \epsilon^n \, .
\end{equation}
Because the contact interaction is expected to scale linear with the momentum cutoff and thus linear in $1/\epsilon$ (see \eqref{three-d-counterterm}), one cannot generally expect the fit coefficients $e_{i,n}^{(n_s)}$ to be zero for odd $n$ or $n < n_s$, despite the kinetic improvement~\eqref{gamma determination}.
Nevertheless, we would expect the small $n$ coefficient for larger $n_s$ to be relatively smaller then small $n$ coefficients for smaller $n_s$: $e_{i,n}^{(n_{s_1})} < e_{i,n}^{(n_{s_2})}$ on average for $n_{s_1} > n_{s_2}$.

We individually fit each discretization implementation to extract the continuum energies $E_i^{(n_s)}$ using the software provided by \Ref{peter_lepage_2016_60221}.
Because our numerical uncertainties have an estimated relative error at the order $~10^{-13}$, we must in principle fit the energy for relatively high values of $n_\mathrm{max}$ which would require having many data points over different scales of $\epsilon$.
For this reason we add further lattice spacings
\begin{equation}
	\left\{
		\epsilon \, [\mathrm{fm}] =
		\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{10},
		\frac{1}{15}, \frac{1}{20}, \frac{1}{25},
		\frac{1}{ 30}, \frac{1}{ 35}, \frac{1}{ 40},
		\frac{1}{ 41}, \frac{1}{ 42}, \frac{1}{ 43},
		\frac{1}{ 44}, \frac{1}{45}, \frac{1}{ 46},
		\frac{1}{ 47}, \frac{1}{ 48}, \frac{1}{ 49}, \frac{1}{ 50}
	\right\}
	\, .
\end{equation}
However, we still obtain $\chi^2_{\mathrm{d.o.f}} \gg 1$ up to the point where it is computationally not feasible to add new data points for even smaller lattice spacings as the dimension of the hamiltonian scales with $(L/\epsilon)^3$.

For this reason, we have decided to fit multiple fit models over the span of $n_\mathrm{max} = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and compare their results to estimate a systematic extrapolation uncertainty (unweighted average and standard deviation of results over models).
We repeat this procedure for each discretization and compare different continuum energies to decide wether the fits are consistent.
These values are compared to the spectrum predicted by L\"uscher's formalism.

We present the model average over best fits of the spectrum in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum}.
Also, we provide access to the raw data and fitting scripts online at \cite{luescher-nd_201}.
We observe that the model average for polynomials of degree 2 up to 5 is consistent over different discretization and agrees with the expected continuum results.
We noted that including higher polynomials with $n_\mathrm{max} > 6$ resulted in overfitting of higher energy levels visible in oscillating fit functions which were generally were more favorable in model selection criteria\footnote{
    A potential cure for overfitting of higher polynomials would have been the marginalization of higher contributions which would cast the contributions of higher neglected epsilon terms into the uncertainty of the data.
    We eventually settled for an unweighted model average over smaller $n_\mathrm{max}$ because the continuum-extrapolated spectrum was more consistent over different $n_s$.
}.
As expected, the continuum limit becomes more uncertain for excited states.
Furthermore, the $n_s = \infty$ implementation provides the most precise results.
Surprisingly a few energy levels in the $n_s = 1$ implementation have a more precise continuum limit on average than some improved implementations -- even though non-extrapolated energy values are further apart from the continuum as in the improved cases.
This effect is related to the continuum convergence pattern.
While the $n_s = 1$ (and $n_s = \infty$) energy values seem to converge against the continuum result from below (and respectively from above) for all excited states, the improved derivative eigenvalues change their convergence pattern.
The slope of the extrapolation function changes it sign from $E_2 \to E_4$ for $n_s = 2$ and from $E_6 \to E_8$ for  $n_s = 4$.
This suggests that the importance of fit model coefficients $e_{i,n}^{(n_s)}$ changes and thus makes it more difficult to perform the continuum limit.

In the next step, we use the continuum-extrapolated spectrum to convert it to phase shifts using the spherical zeta function.
We present the phase shifts in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-ere}.
Independent of discretization scheme, we observe that the continuum-extrapolated results agree with the constant input phase shifts.
Because the zeta function is relatively steep, uncertainties in the continuum limit get drastically enhanced when converting to phase shifts (on average more than an order of magnitude).
We observe that for $x > 5$ all discretizations besides the exact-$p^2$ discretization come with significant uncertainties.

        Data points indicate locations of the eigenvalue.
        We show the propagated error associated with continuum extrapolation as an uncertainty band.
        The black dashed line represents physical phase shifts.
        Bands stop at different $x$ values because we stop presenting results after uncertainties become too large (but are still consistent with the physical phase shifts).

We emphasize that these findings are not unique to the unitary case, we obtain similar results for a non-zero scattering length.
We present data for an example non-unitarity scenario with $a_{30} = - 5$~fm in our repository \cite{luescher-nd_201}.

\subsection{Using \Luscher's formula before continuum extrapolation}
Next we want to discuss what effects finite discretization artifacts have when applying L\"uscher's formalism to a spectrum for finite lattice spacings.
We insert the energy levels presented in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum} before taking the continuum limit and present results in figure \figref{unimproved spherical}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{
        \label{fig:unimproved spherical}
        We present energy eigenvalues presented in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum} directly inserted $S^{\spherical}_3$--without a continuum limit.
        In the top row we show results for $L=1.0$~fm, in bottom we show $L=2.0$~fm, while in different columns we show different discretization schemes.
        Even though results for $n_s = 2$ seem to be close to the continuum limit result, they start to drastically oscillate for higher energies.
        While more improved discretization schemes seem to oscillate less, they do not lay on top of the continuum result where the difference is related to the lattice spacing.
    }
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \scalebox{1.0}{\input{figure/ere-continuum-extrapolation.pgf}}
    \caption{
        \label{fig:iv-continuum}
        Continuum limit of different phase shift points computed by inserting finite lattice spacing eigenstates in $S^{\spherical}_3$ (see \figref{unimproved spherical}).
        Each column represents a different kinetic operator and each row tracks a different eigenvalue of the discrete finite-volume hamiltonian.
        Note that both axis have a log scale and thus on these scales, a linear trend for the phase shifts suggests that they extrapolate to zero.
    }
\end{figure}

We note that the phase shifts for $x > 10$ start to oscillate wildly.
This is the case because energy values are close to the poles of the zeta function (close to the frame boundaries in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum}).  With an imperfect kinetic operator, the lattice artifacts in the energy can push energy levels past a pole in the continuum zeta.  This leads to multiple interacting energy levels on a single segment of the zeta function.

Furthermore it seems like the small $x$ results for $n_s = 2$ seem to be closer to the expected flat result than other discretization schemes.
This behavior can be explained by \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum}.
While other discretization schemes for $x < 8$ monotonically converge against the continuum limit, $n_s = 2$ data points converge non-monotonically and are therefore closer to the continuum by accident.
In this sense it is possible to select a discretization scheme which in principle converges slower against the continuum, but has an accidental good agreement with the continuum even though it is discrete.

For small energies, better discretization schemes or small lattice spacings, we observe that the phase shifts do not oscillate and monotonically increase in $x$ with no or small curvature.
This non-flat $x$-dependence seems to depend less on the employed discretization scheme but certainly on the value of the lattice spacing.
This suggests that artifacts of the imperfect kinetic operator are negligible compared to cutoff effects of the lattice spacing itself.
The non-zero lattice spacing induces effective-range-like effects.
As we will show in the next section, this effect arises from using the continuum $S^{\spherical}$ rather than the lattice-aware $S^{\dispersion}$.

We visualize the continuum limit of phase shift points in \figref{iv-continuum}.
Similar to the case where we first extrapolated the spectrum to the continuum and computed phase shifts afterwards, the best discretization allows to also extrapolate higher excited states to zero--visible by the linear log-log dependence of the phase shifts on epsilon.
We note that similar to the case where we first extrapolated the spectrum to the continuum, the extrapolation of the phase shifts seems to work best for the same discretization schemes in the same energy range.
For example, while we find a linear log-log scaling region in \figref{iv-continuum} for $n_s = 2$ and $x<6$, uncertainties of the $n_s =2$ extrapolation also start to increase in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum} after $x>6$.
However the $n_s = 4$ implementation seems to be stable longer in \figref{iv-continuum} which is related to the $x>9$ state having a relatively larger continuum extrapolation uncertainty while also being close to the continuum value.
