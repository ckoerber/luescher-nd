# First Reply to editor: Question.

Dear Dr. {insert_editor},

We would like to thank you and the referee for your efforts and criticism.

We intend to update our draft according to the suggestions made and formulate a more detailed reply addressing the raised concerns in the next weeks.

As one part of the criticism is the technical nature of our paper, we intend to further sharpen the context and impact of the proposed formalism. Unfortunately, the referee does not provide much explanation about this concern. Knowing that addressing the criticism does not guarantee publication in PRC, would it be possible to ask the referee further questions to inform the upcoming adjustments?

As correctly recognized by the referee, the prime contribution of the paper is the derivation of exact infinite-volume continuum scattering information extracted from finite-volume discretized space computations. Direct applications are in systems of unitary fermions, and specifically in nuclear physics which are close to unitary systems because of the large scattering length in the 1S0 channel. Because our general derivation of scattering information is independent of dimensions, we decided to include specific derivations for 1- and 2-dimensional systems in the main text as well. Does the referee feel that focussing on the 3-dimensional case, particularly focussing on nuclear physics, might benefit the argumentation--so that we delegate the other cases to the appendix?

We are happy to receive feedback.

Best regards,

Christopher KÃ¶rber, Evan Berkowitz and Thomas Luu
