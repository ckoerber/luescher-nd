\subsection{Dispersion L\"uscher in 2 dimensions}

The discussion above is valid only in the continuum.
For a discretized lattice, an additional length scale is introduced that must be accounted for.
As is the case in both 3-D and 1-D, there exists a dispersion L\"uscher equation that is valid for the contact interaction and accounts for the discretization.
In \Appref{3D dispersion} we derive this dispersion L\"uscher formula for 2D and only state the result here.

Identifying the lattice spacing $\epsilon=N/L$, we have
\begin{align}
    \frac{2}{\pi} \log \left(\frac{2\pi \tilde a_{2}}{L}\right)
    &=
    \frac{1}{\pi^2}
    \left(
        \sum_{n_x,n_y=-\frac{N}{2}}^{\frac{N}{2}-1}\frac{1}{\tilde{K}^N_{nn}-x^\dispersion}
        -2\pi \log \left(\mathcal{L}^\dispersion_2\frac{N}{2}\right)
    \right)
    \nonumber\\
    &\equiv\frac{1}{\pi^2}S^{\dispersion}_2\left(x^\dispersion\right)\, ,\label{eq:2d dispersion luscher}
	\qquad
    \mathcal{L}^\dispersion_{2}
    =
    \exp \left(\log (2)-G \frac{2}{\pi}\right)
    =
    1.116306393581637659468497 \ldots
\end{align}
and $G$ is Catalan's constant. %\todo{Hmmm. . . this counterterm has an $N$ dependence, right?}

%Given a contact interaction with coefficient appropriately tuned to the continuum scattering length $\tilde a_{2}$ and accounts for the discretization $\epsilon=N/L$ (see \Appref{dispersion-counterterm}),
%\begin{equation}
%C(N/L)=-\frac{ \pi}{\mu \log \left(\tilde a_{2} \mathcal{L}^\dispersion_2 \frac{N}{L}\pi\right)}\ ,
%\end{equation}
%the finite-spacing finite-volume energy eigenvalues of Schr\"odinger's equation on a square lattice will exactly satisfy the quantization condition \eqref{2d dispersion luscher}.

%\todo{\@TOM: was this tuned using $S^{\spherical}$ or $S^{\dispersion}$? Am I getting your procedure right?}
To demonstrate the success of this formula we tuned lattices with $N=10$, 20, and 40 to $\tilde a_{2}/L = {1}/{10}$, which allows for a bound state, using $S^{\dispersion}$.
In \Figref{luescher2d} the black points were analyzed through $S^\dispersion_2$, and lie on a flat line, indicating that our dispersion \Luscher formula has correctly accounted for discretization effects.
On the other hand, if we use the same energies but analyze them with the usual continuum \Luscher function $S^{\spherical}_2$, shown as colored points, we see induced momentum-dependence and the flat line behavior is lost.

        	Finite-spacing eigenvalues $x^\dispersion=2\mu E^\dispersion L^2/4\pi^2$ of the Schr\"odinger equation are inserted into respective zeta functions to obtain phase shifts.
			The eigenvalues are obtained for a contact interaction which fulfills eq.~\eqref{C2} in the spherical case and eq.~\eqref{C2-dispersion} in the dispersion case.
			Both tunings are fixed to $\tilde a_{2}/L=1/10$ (closed symbols) and $\tilde a_{2}/L=0$ (open symbols).
			Different markers correspond to different discretization; $N=4$ (triangles), 10 (squares), 12 (diamonds), and 14 (hexagons).
        	For analysis, the colored points are obtained using $S^\spherical_2(x^\dispersion)$; corresponding to $N=4$ (red), 10 (green), 20 (blue), and 40 (purple).
        	The thin colored lines are the derived induced momentum-dependent terms for each $N$ as given in \Tabref{induced terms in 2 d}.
        	The black points are obtained using the $N$-appropriate $S^{\dispersion}_2(x^\dispersion)$ and exhibit the correct flat-line behavior.
        	The dashed gray line is $S_2^\spherical$, as in the bottom panel.

As was done in the three- and one-dimensional cases, we can derive the functional form of the induced momentum-dependent terms.
The derivation is identical to those cases; for concision we show only the end result.
Expanded around small $x^\dispersion$ one finds
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2D corrections}
    S^\bigcirc_{2}\left(x^\dispersion\right)
    =
    2\pi\log\left(2\pi \frac{\tilde a_{2}}{L}\right)
    + \alpha_1(N)
    + \alpha_2(N) x^\dispersion
    + \alpha_3(N) (x^\dispersion)^2
    + \ldots
\end{equation}
The coefficients $\alpha_i(N)$ have an implicit dependence on $N$ since the sums are restricted outside of the Brillouin zone.  Further, in 2-D the sums involved in $\alpha_i$ converge sufficiently fast and there exist various techniques for evaluating these sums (see, e.g. Appendix A of~\cite{Fiebig:1994qi}).
We provide the numerical values of $\alpha_i(N)$ in \autoref{tab:induced terms in 2 d} for the discretizations shown in \autoref{fig:luescher2d}.
These functions were also used to calculate the thin colored lines in \autoref{fig:luescher2d}, where we see the small-$x$ expansion lose accuracy quickly for $N=4$ (consider the bound state, for example) but hold deeper into the spectrum for larger $N$.
