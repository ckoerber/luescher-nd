\subsection{Dispersion L\"uscher in 2 dimensions}
The discussion above is valid only in the continuum.  For a discretized lattice, an additional length scale is introduced that must be accounted for.  As is the case in both 3-D and 1-D, there exists a dispersion L\"uscher equation that is valid for the contact interaction and accounts for the discretization.  In \autoref{sec:counterterm/dispersion} we derive this dispersion L\"uscher formula for 2-D and only state the result here.  Identifying the lattice spacing $\epsilon=N/L$, we have
\begin{align}
\frac{2}{\pi} \log \left(\frac{2\pi \tilde a_{20}}{L}\right)&=\frac{1}{\pi^2}\left( \sum_{n_x,n_y=-\frac{N}{2}}^{\frac{N}{2}-1}\frac{1}{\vec{n}^2-\left(\frac{pL}{2\pi}\right)^2}-2\pi \log \left(\mathcal{L}_\square\frac{N}{2}\right)\right)\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{\pi^2}S^{\dispersion}_2\left(\left(\frac{pL}{2\pi}\right)^2\right)\ ,\label{eq:2d dispersion luscher}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\square}=\exp \left(\log (2)-G \frac{2}{\pi}\right)=1.116306393581637659468497 \ldots
\end{equation}
and $G$ is Catalan's constant.

Given a contact interaction with coefficient appropriately tuned to the continuum scattering length $\tilde a_{20}$ and accounts for the discretization $\epsilon=N/L$ (see \autoref{sec:counterterm/dispersion}),
\begin{equation}
C(N/L)=-\frac{2 \pi}{m \log \left(\tilde a_{20} \mathcal{L}_\square \frac{N}{L}\pi\right)}\ ,
\end{equation}
the eigenvalues $x=\left(\frac{pL}{2\pi}\right)^2$ of Schr\"odinger's equation on a \emph{discretized} square lattice will exactly satisfy eq.~\eqref{2d dispersion luscher}.

\caption{Results in 2-D using non-continuum eigenvalues $x=p^2L^2/4\pi^2$ of the Schr\"odinger equation with $N=10$, 20, and 40.  The interaction was tuned such that $\tilde a_{20}/L=.1$.  The colored points are obtained using $S^\bigcirc_2(x)$ with $N=10$ being furthest from a flat line and $N=40$ being closest.  The black points are obtained using $S^{\dispersion}_2(x)$  and exhibit the correct flat-line behavior.  The colored dashed lines are the derived induced momentum-dependent terms (see text) \todo{Need better figure. -T.L.}\label{fig:luescher2d}}
\end{figure}
This is depicted in \autoref{fig:luescher2d} by the black points which were calculated with $N=10$, 20, and 40.  Here the scattering length was set to $\tilde a_{20}/L = .1$, which allows for a bound state.  All black points lie on a flat line, indicating that our dispersion L\"uscher has correctly accounted for discretization effects.  On the other hand, if we use the same energies but insert them into continuum L\"uscher (eq.~\eqref{2d luscher}), as depicted by the colored points, momentum-dependent terms are induced and the flat line behavior is lost.

As was done in the 3-D\todo{still needs to be done.-T.L.} and 1-D cases, we can derive the functional form of the induced momentum-dependent terms.  The steps are identical to those done in the 3-D and 1-D cases, and so for conciseness we show only the end result.  Assuming an $x=\left(\frac{pL}{2\pi}\right)^2$ calculated on a \emph{discretized} lattice with lattice spacing $\epsilon=N/L$, we have
\begin{align*}
 \frac{1}{ \pi^{2}} S^\bigcirc_{2}\left(x\right)&=\frac{2}{\pi}\log\left(2\pi \frac{\tilde a_{20}}{L}\right)+ \frac{1}{ \pi^{2}} S^\bigcirc_{2}\left(x\right)- \frac{1}{ \pi^{2}} S^{\dispersion}_{2}\left(x\right)\\
 &=\frac{2}{\pi}\log\left(2\pi \frac{\tilde a_{20}}{L}\right)+\frac{1}{\pi^{2}} \left(\lim_{\eta\to\infty}\sum_{n\notin \operatorname{B.Z.}}^{|n|\le\frac{\eta}{2}} \frac{1}{n^{2}-x} -2\pi\log\left(\frac{\eta}{\mathcal{L}_\square N}\right)\right)\\
&=\frac{2}{\pi}\log\left(2\pi \frac{\tilde a_{20}}{L}\right)+\frac{1}{\pi^{2}} \left(\lim_{\eta\to\infty}\sum_{n\notin \operatorname{B.Z.}}^{|n|\le\frac{\eta}{2}}  \frac{1}{n^{2}} -2\pi\log\left(\frac{\eta}{\mathcal{L}_\square N}\right)\right)
+\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}\sum_{n\notin \operatorname{B.Z.}} \frac{x}{n^{4}} +\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}\sum_{n\notin \operatorname{B.Z.}} \frac{x^2}{n^{6}}+\mathcal{O}(x^3)\\
&\equiv\frac{2}{\pi}\log\left(2\pi \frac{\tilde a_{20}}{L}\right)+\alpha_0(N)+\alpha_1(N) x+\alpha_2(N) x^2 +\mathcal{O}(x^3) \ .
\end{align*}
The coefficients $\alpha_i(N)$ have an implicit dependence on $N$ since the sums are restricted outside of the Brillouin zone.  Further, in 2-D the sums involved in $\alpha_i$ converge sufficiently fast and thus require no acceleration techniques.  We provide
