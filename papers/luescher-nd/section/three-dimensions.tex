\section{Analysis in both 3 dimensions and 1 dimension}
\todo{@CK: Stuff}
We begin our discussion with L\"uscher's formalism in both three dimensions and one dimension.  Aside from the obvious change in units and reduced dimensionality when going from three to one dimension, the technical aspects of either case are similar enough that there is no reason to discuss them separately.  On the other hand, there are subtle technical issues leading to large differences in two dimensions, and so we reserve the discussion of L\"uscher's formalism in two dimensions in a subsequent section.
