\section{Three Dimensions}\label{sec:3D}


Now we can attempt a numerical characterization of two fermions at unitarity (and for finite scattering length).
We implement the Hamiltonian in \eqref{p space hamiltonian} in a three-dimensional cubic box of linear size $L$ with lattice spacing $\epsilon$.
At first, we concentrate on tuning the interaction strength $C(\Lambda)$ such that the ground state energy $E_0$ matches the first zero of the spherical zeta function $S^{\spherical}_3$ (eq.~\eqref{spherical quantization} and see also \figref{tuning}).
In our computations, the low-lying energy levels for fixed physical volume and fixed lattice spacing are extracted using numeric exact diagonalization after the strength is tuned to machine precision.
The zeta function is evaluated using software provided by \Refs{Morningstar:2017spu,Morningstar:2hib}.

This tuning procedure ensures that the FV effects are incorporated in the energy levels and thus the contact interaction strength is independent of the volume length $L$.
However, the interaction strength still depends on the implementation of the Kinetic operator and the lattice spacing, $C(\Lambda)\to C^{(n_s)}(\pi/\epsilon)$.
Therefore the strength has to be retuned for each lattice implementation.
This lattice dependence has the consequence that each lattice observable, e.g., the energy spectrum (besides the input ground state), has to extrapolated to the continuum limit first to extract \textit{pure} FV energy levels.
These FV energy levels can be used in Lüscher's formalism to extract infinite volume scattering data.

    Constant phase shifts (colored lines) described by a contact interaction and the three-dimensional zeta function $\frac{1}{\pi L} S^{\spherical}_3$ (dashed line).
    The Finite Volume energy spectrum is extracted by computing the intersections of the zeta function with the phase shifts (see \eqref{spherical quantization}).
    The first intersection $x_0$, which corresponds to the binding energy $E_0 < 0$, is used to tune the interaction $c^{(n_s)}(\epsilon)$ for a given lattice implementation.
    This treatment allows to determine $c^{(n_s)}(\epsilon)$ independent of volume sizes.

In practice, it is not always possible to compute a continuum limit before inserting the FV spectrum into Lüscher's formalism.
We therefore attempt both approaches, performing a continuum limit before and after inserting energy levels in Lüscher's zeta function to the obtained spectrum.

In the following section we present results obtained for the spherical and dispersion quantization conditions computed for the following parameters
\begin{equation}
    \{ L \,[\mathrm{fm}]= 1, 2 \}
    \times \left\{ \epsilon \,[\mathrm{fm}] = \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{20}, \frac{1}{40}, \frac{1}{50} \right\}
    \times \{ n_s = 1, 2, 3, 4, \infty \}
    \, ,
\end{equation}
as long as $N = L / \epsilon \leq 50$.
