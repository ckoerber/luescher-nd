\subsubsection{Continuum extrapolation before infinite volume limit}

After tuning the contact interaction to the first zero of the spherical zeta function, we compute the spectrum of the hamiltonian.
Next, we extrapolate the obtained energy eigenvalues to the continuum $\epsilon \to 0$ using a polynomial fit
\begin{equation}
    E^{(n_s)}_i(\epsilon) = E_i^{(n_s)} + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{n_\mathrm{max}} e_{i,n}^{(n_s)} \epsilon^n \, .
\end{equation}
Because the contact interaction is expected to scale linear with $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ (see \eqref{FV pole}), one cannot generally expect the fit coefficients $e_{i,n}^{(n_s)}$ to be zero for even $n$ or $n < n_s$ as the dispersion suggests.
Nevertheless, we would expect the small $n$ coefficient for larger $n_s$ to be relatively smaller then small $n$ coefficients for smaller $n_s$.

We individually fit each discretization implementation ($n_s$) to extract the continuum energy $E_i^{(n_s)}$ using the software provided by \cite{peter_lepage_2016_60221}.
Because our numerical uncertainties have an estimated relative error at the order $~10^{-13}$, we must in principle fit the energy for relatively high values of $n_\mathrm{max}$ which would require having many data points over different scales of $\epsilon$.
For this reason we add further epsilon values
\begin{equation}
	\left\{
		\epsilon \, [\mathrm{fm}] =
		\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{10},
		\frac{1}{15}, \frac{1}{20}, \frac{1}{25},
		\frac{1}{ 30}, \frac{1}{ 35}, \frac{1}{ 40},
		\frac{1}{ 41}, \frac{1}{ 42}, \frac{1}{ 43},
		\frac{1}{ 44}, \frac{1}{45}, \frac{1}{ 46},
		\frac{1}{ 47}, \frac{1}{ 48}, \frac{1}{ 49}, \frac{1}{ 50}
	\right\}
	\, .
\end{equation}
However, we still obtain $\chi^2_{\mathrm{d.o.f}} \gg 1$ up to the point where it is computationally not feasible to add new data points for even smaller lattice spacings as the dimension of the hamiltonian scales with $(L/\epsilon)^3$.

For this reason, we have decided to fit multiple fit models over the span of $n_\mathrm{max} = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and compare their results to estimate a systematic extrapolation uncertainty (unweighted average and standard deviation of results over models).
We repeat this procedure for each discretization and compare different continuum energies to decide wether the fits have been successful.
These values are compared to the spectrum predicted by Lüscher's formalism.

We present the model average over best fits of the spectrum in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum}.
Also, we provide access to the raw data and fitting scripts online at \cite{repo}\todo{repo link}.
We observe that the model average for polynomials of degree 2 up to 5 is consistent over different discretization and agrees with the expected continuum results.
As expected, the continuum limit becomes more uncertain for excited states.
Furthermore, the $n_s = \infty$ implementation provides the most precise results.
Surprisingly it seems like the $n_s = 1$ implementation seems to be more precise on average then the improved implementations -- even though non-extrapolated values are further apart from the continuum as in the other cases.
This effect is related to the continuum convergence pattern.
While the $n_s = 1$ ($n_s = \infty$) energy values seem to converge against the continuum result from below (above) for all excited states, the improved derivative eigenvalues change their convergence pattern.
The slope of the extrapolation function changes it sign from $E_2 \to E_4$ for $n_s = 2$ and from $E_6 \to E_8$ for  $n_s = 4$.
This suggests that the importance of fit model coefficients $e_{i,n}^{(n_s)}$ changes and thus make it more difficult to perform the continuum limit.

In the next step, we use the continuum extrapolated spectrum to convert it to phase shifts using the spherical zeta function.
We present the phase shifts in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-ere}.
Independent of discretization scheme, we observe that the continuum extrapolated results agree with the constant input phase shifts.
Because the zeta function is relatively steep, uncertainties in the continuum limit get drastically enhanced when converting to phase shifts.
We observe that for for $x > 5$ all discretization besides the $n_s = \infty$ discretization come with significant uncertainties.

    Each column represents a different implementation of the Kinetic operator, rows correspond to eigenvalues of the hamiltonian sorted by size.
    For visualization purposes we present each second eigenvalue starting at $E_2$ because $E_0$ was used to tune the interaction and is thus constant by definition.
    Black dots are the eigenvalues at different lattice spacings, the green band is the model averaged fit function for best parameters and the blue band parallel to the x-axis is the continuum extrapolated energy.
    The dashed line corresponds to the expected result obtained by computing the intersection of the zeta function with the phase shifts.
    The boundary of each frame corresponds to the poles of the zeta function.
    Different energy extrapolations in the continuum agree with Lüscher's prediction within uncertainty.
    For finite discretization implementations ($n_s < \infty$), the uncertainty drastically increases with the number of excited states ($\sim4$ orders of magnitude from $E_2^{(n_s)}$ to $E_{20}^{(n_s)}$).

We emphasize that these findings are not unique to the unitary case, we obtain similar results for a non-zero scattering length.
We present data for the non-unitarity scenario, e.g., $a_{30} = - 5 \, [\mathrm{fm}]$ in our repository \cite{repo}.

\subsubsection{Infinite volume limit before continuum extrapolation}
Next we want to discuss what effects finite discretization artifacts have when applying Lüscher's formalism to a spectrum for finite lattice spacings.
We insert the energy levels presented in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum} before taking the continuum limit and present results in figure \figref{unimproved spherical}.

    \label{fig:unimproved spherical}
\end{figure}

We note that the phase shifts for $x > 10$ start to oscillate widely.
This is the case because energy values are close to the poles of the zeta function, e.g., close to the frame boundaries in \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum}.

Furthermore it seems like the small $x$ $n_s = 2$ results seem to be closer to the expected flat result as other discretization schemes.
This behavior can be explained by \figref{continuum-extrapolation-spectrum}.
While other discretization schemes for $x < 8$ monotonously converge against the continuum limit, $n_s = 2$ data points converge non-monotonously and are therefore closer to the continuum by accident.


For small energies, better discretization schemes or small lattice spacings, we observe that the phase shifts do not oscillate and monotonously increase in $x$ with no or small curvature.
This non-flat $x$-dependence seems to depend less on the employed discretization scheme but certainly on the value of the lattice spacing.
This suggests that artifacts of the imperfect Kinetic operator are negligible compared to cutoff effects of the lattice spacing itself.
The non-zero lattice spacing induces effective range like effects.

We try to fit the extrapolate the slope of the small $x$-dependence and extrapolate such results to $\epsilon \to 0$ in \figref{iv-continuum}.
