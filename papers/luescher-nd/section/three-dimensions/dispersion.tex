\subsubsection{Dispersion L\"{u}scher removes induced artifacts}

In this section, we again attempt to tune our contact interaction to unitarity by matching the first zero of the \Luscher zeta function.
However, the difference is that at each lattice spacing we tune to that spacing's respective $S^{\dispersion N}_D$, leveraging the dispersion relation for that derivative.
Then, when we extract finite-volume and finite-spacing energy levels, we put them through the dispersion equation \todo{eqref} using the same $S$ function.\footnote{We actually make the replacement $\F_D^\epsilon\goesto\F_D$ to avoid numerically evaluating $F_D^\epsilon$.  With a controlled continuum limit the error from this change obviously vanishes.}
The numerical results of said procedure are shown in \Figref{unimproved dispersion}.
Note that the results for $p\cot\delta$ are now flat across the spectrum, matching the known result for a contact interaction.
Moreover, comparing the scale to that in, for example, \Figref{unimproved spherical}, there the deviations were of order~1, while here the results remain within $10^{-8}$ of zero, with the value entirely reflecting how well the contact interaction was tuned.

In \Figref{dispersion running of strength} we show how the strength of the contact interaction runs with the lattice scale.  According to \todo{something we know} it should be \todo{some formula that depends on cutoff}.

        Scaling of the contact interaction strength $C(\epsilon)$ fitted using the dispersion method at unitarity.
        Data points are fitted values, solid lines are analytical scaling predictions following $C(\epsilon) = \frac{2}{\mu} \frac{1}{\mathcal L^{\dispersion n_\mathrm{step}}} \epsilon $ and the dashed line corresponds to the spherical predictions.
        Bar diagrams below present the absolute error between prediction and extracted value.
