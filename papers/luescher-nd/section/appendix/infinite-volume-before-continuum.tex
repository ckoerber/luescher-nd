        \label{fig:iv-continuum}
        Continuum limit of different phase shift points computed by inserting finite lattice spacing eigenstates in $S^{\spherical}_3$ (see \figref{unimproved spherical}).
        Each column represents a different kinetic operator and each row tracks a different eigenvalue of the discrete finite-volume hamiltonian.
        Note that both axis have a log scale and thus on these scales, a linear trend for the phase shifts suggests that they extrapolate to zero.
