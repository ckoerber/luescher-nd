\section{\Luscher's Formulae}\label{sec:luescher}

In subsequent sections we will extract scattering data from numerical calculations for particular box sizes and discretizations.
We will show that when tuned and analyzed using the traditional \Luscher method, we induce a momentum-dependent scattering amplitude at any finite lattice spacing and explain how to achieve a momentum-independent scattering amplitude, even at finite lattice spacing, by constructing a lattice-aware \Luscher-like method.

For concreteness of our discussion we here provide a derivation of \Luscher's S-wave formula roughly following \Ref{Beane:2003da}, although the technology and sophistication of the finite-volume formalism has grown substantially \cite{Ozaki:2012ce,Hansen:2012tf,Briceno:2013hya,Briceno:2013lba,Li:2014wga,Zhu:2019dho}, and the give the spacing-corrected procedure.
