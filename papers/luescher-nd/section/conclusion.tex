\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Calculations of the Bertsch parameter should take advantage of the tuning that can be done with the dispersion function.

\begin{itemize}
    \item It'd be good to get a relativistic formulation.
    \item If, in an analysis of finite-spacing spectra, you see two states on the same branch of $S^\spherical$ you're probably seeing two states on different branches of $S^\dispersion$.
\end{itemize}
