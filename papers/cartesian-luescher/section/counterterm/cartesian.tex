\section{The Cartesian \Luscher Finite-Volume Counterterm}\label{sec:counterterm/cartesian}

To determine the counterterm in the Cartesian volume we need to evaluate the large-$N$ limit of the integral
\begin{equation}
	I^{\cartesian N}_0(x=0) = \int_{-N/2}^{+N/2} \mathrm{d}n_x\ \mathrm{d}n_y\ \mathrm{d}n_z \frac{1}{n^2}
\end{equation}
where $n^2 = n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2$ and we henceforth suppress the $(x=0)$ argument.
We can evaluate it as follows.  Consider the integral
\begin{equation}
	J^{\cartesian N}_0(x, m) = \int_{-N/2}^{+N/2} dn_x\ dn_y\ dn_z\ \frac{e^{-m n^2}}{n^2}.
\end{equation}
Then, we know $\lim_{m\goesto\infty} J^{\cartesian N}_0(m) = 0$ and $J^{\cartesian N}_0(0) = I^{\cartesian N}_0$.
We can take advantage of the fundamental theorem of calculus,
\begin{align}
	I^{\cartesian N}_0 = J^{\cartesian N}_0(0) - J^{\cartesian N}_0(\infty)
		&= 	\int_{\infty}^{0} dm\ \partial_m J^{\cartesian N}_0(m)
		% \\
		&&=	\int_{\infty}^{0} dm\ \int_{-N/2}^{+N/2} dn_x\ dn_y\ dn_z\ -e^{-m n^2}
		\nonumber\\
		&=	\int_0^\infty dm\ \left(\int_{-N/2}^{+N/2} dn\ e^{-m n^2}\right)^3
		% \\
		&&=	\int_0^\infty dm\ \left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{m}} \erf(\sqrt{m N^2/4})\right)^3
\end{align}
where we exchanged the order of partial differentiation by $m$ and momenta integration, recognize the resulting integral as three identical copies of the same integral (as long as the volume is a cube), and evaluate it, yielding the error function.
Changing variables to isolate the dependence on $N$, $\mu^2 = m N^2/4$, we find
\begin{align}
    I^{\cartesian N}_0
    &=
    \pi^{3/2}\ \frac{N}{2} \int_{0}^\infty 2\mu\ \mathrm{d}\mu\ \left(\frac{\erf(\mu)}{\mu}\right)^3
\end{align}
and the integral can be easily evaluated numerically, yielding $2.75634$ so that
\begin{equation}
    \counterterm^\cartesian_3 \left(\frac{N}{2}\right) = \lim_{N\goesto\infty}I^{\cartesian N}_0(x=0) = 15.34824844488746404710\ \left(\frac{N}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
and more digits are readily available; this constant appears in \eqref{S cartesian}.
This can be compared to the spherical counterterm, which we can read off from \eqref{improved spherical S}, where the counter term can be seen to be $4\pi \approx 12.6 $; that the Cartesian result is larger reflects the fact that more of the momentum space is included in the integration domain for a fixed $N$, as discussed in \Secref{cartesian}.

This method of evaluation can be repeated for higher spatial dimensions.
For $D\geq3$ spatial dimensions one finds
\begin{equation}
    \pi^{D/2} \left(\frac{N}{2}\right)^{D-2} \int_0^\infty 2\mu\ \mathrm{d}\mu\ \left(\frac{\erf(\mu)}{\mu}\right)^D
\end{equation}
For four dimensions one finds $17.14741624920737 (N/2)^2$, $24.49922817921121 (N/2)^3$ for five dimensions, for six dimensions $38.50096808074375 (N/2)^4$, and so on.

The logarithmic divergence in two dimensions must be handled especially carefully.

In fact, we can execute a similar construction in three (and higher) dimensions.  In three dimensions, \todo{TOM'S G+POLYLOG MAGIC}.
