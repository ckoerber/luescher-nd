\section{The Dispersion Function}\label{sec:dispersion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Show errors of putting not-continuum spectrum through continuum S.  Dispersion S even accounts for lattice spacing!
    \item If we tune to dispersion S rather than continuum S at each lattice spacing the continuum limit is much nicer, especially for low modes.
    \item 2D, 3D.
    \item Show $C(\Lambda)$.
\end{itemize}
