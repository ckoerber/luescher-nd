\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}


We construct the Hamiltonians explicitly and diagonalize them exactly.
Typically \Luscher's finite volume formalism is thought of as a tool for analyzing Monte Carlo data (for example, in lattice QCD), but here we can escape all the complications introduced by statistical uncertainty and completely isolate the features of the formalism itself, exposing some problems and solving them.


Amy, Mike, David etc. found a problem, which we reproduce in \Secref{spherical}.  They tried tuning but caused themselves a headache.  What happened?  \Luscher's formula was wrong.  We fix it, and win glory.
